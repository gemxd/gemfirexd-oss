hydra.Prms-testDescription = "
This test executes operations on entries on a PartitionedRegion and carefully
validates for correctness. The data store for the partitioned region is spread
across all VMs. The test uses serial round robin; the first thread
in the round does random operation(s), then stops and restarts
the other client VMs, then all other threads in the round verify their view of 
the operation. After the last thread in the round verifies, it then becomes the 
first in the next round, thus the thread doing the random operation changes for 
each round.
